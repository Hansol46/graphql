# about GraphQL

**GraphQL** is a query language created by Facebook in 2012 due to collisions with the limitations of traditional **REST APIs** (more on that later). Since **GraphQL** is just a specification, the server can be implemented in Node.js, php, Ruby; and the client side, for example, on Relay or Apollo (there are both React-Apollo and Angular-Apollo). To compare **GraphQL** and **REST**, you can use a metaphor. Traditional **REST** is like making an appointment with a dentist, ordering delivery, and calling a car repair service using three phone calls to three different phone numbers.

</p>

**GraphQL**, in turn, acts as our personal assistant, allowing us to give him the opportunity to book you to the dentist, deliver delivery and connect with the machine repair service. We ask for what we need and then just wait.

## Where to begin?

Creating a schema. The schema is the skeleton of the entire server side, which contains all our requests. We can consider an example of a schema:

<p align="center" display="flex">
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/3mTcSQG/image.png" width="400" height="400" title="hover text">
</p>
This schema describes what entities we have in the application and what manipulations we can generally perform with them. Let's talk in more detail about entities and queries.

## 1. Query queries in GraphQL

Using queries, **GraphQL** retrieves the necessary data from the server. **Query** in **GraphQL** is analogous to **GET** in **REST**. Query describes the data to be retrieved from the server. For example, our scheme, using the code below, you can get an array of books `Book` and the second request is to get a book by `id`.

```
        type Query {
	        getAllBooks: [Book]!
	        getBook(id: ID!): Book!
        }
```

Response to this data comes in **JSON** format. Successful operations return a **JSON** with the key and the data, and unsuccessful return **JSON** with the key and the error message. This makes it convenient to handle errors on the client side.

## 2. Mutation –≤ GraphQL

**Mutation** is another root type. If **Query** is analogous to **GET**, then **Mutation** is analogous to **POST** and **PUT** in **REST**. Using this method, you can mutate or, more simply, change the data, for example, add some data to the database. Example code for adding a new book:

```
        type Mutation {
	        addBook(book: BookInput!): Boolean!
        }
```

This create mutation `addBoook`, which adds a new book to the database. 

## 3. Subscription –≤ GraphQL

**Subscription** is the third type of operation in **GraphQL**. With its help, the client listens to changes in the database in real time. Under the hood, subscriptions use websockets. Example code (relatively speaking, if it was possible to add like books):

```
        subscription listenLikes {
          listenLikes {
            Book
            likes
          }
        }

```

With this query, you can get a list of users with names and number of likes every time a user gets a like.

## Next step - create resolvers 

To bind our data to the schema, we use **resolvers**, in our case it is `root`. The fields in this object fully correspond to what was in the schema, all we need to do is specify which function to execute when a field is requested

<p align="center" display="flex">
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/jGMvQQW/image.png" width="400" height="400" title="hover text">
</p>

In our case, `allBookis` just an array of books containing books in the required format

## Convenient console 

Included with GraphQL comes GraphiQL - a special console that visually displays requests. View example:
<p align="center" display="flex">
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/KX3k8dz/image.png" width="600" height="400" title="hover text">
</p>

In it, we can write the queries we need and immediately see the result. What is even more convenient, this console is documentation, on the right on thebutton **Docs** all entities, mutations that are in our schema are described

## Display data 

Great way is to use Apollo https://www.apollographql.com

Let's analyze in order what needs to be done for this.

* To get started we need to install Apollo ``` npm install @apollo/client graphql ```

* Next we need to create `client`

```
		const client = new ApolloClient({
		  uri: 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io',
		  cache: new InMemoryCache()
		});
```

* Next step, wrap our  `<App />`

```
		function App() {
		  return (
		    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
		      <div>
			<h2>My first Apollo app üöÄ</h2>
		      </div>
		    </ApolloProvider>
		  );
		}
```

* Remains to make a request, in Apollo a special function helps us with this `gql`

```
		const EXCHANGE_RATES = gql`
		  query GetExchangeRates {
		    rates(currency: "USD") {
		      currency
		      rate
		    }
		  }
		`;
```

* Finally, display the data by placing our variable in the hook `useQuert`

```
		function ExchangeRates() {
		  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES);

		  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
		  if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;

		  return data.rates.map(({ currency, rate }) => (
		    <div key={currency}>
		      <p>
			{currency}: {rate}
		      </p>
		    </div>
		  ));
		}
```
